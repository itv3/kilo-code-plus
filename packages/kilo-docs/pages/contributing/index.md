# Contributing Overview

{% callout type="info" %}
**New versions of the VS Code extension and CLI are being developed in [Kilo-Org/kilocode](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode)** (extension at `packages/kilo-vscode`, CLI at `packages/opencode`). If you're looking to contribute to the extension or CLI, please head over to that repository.

Kilo Code is an open-source project that welcomes contributions from developers of all skill levels. This guide will help you get started with contributing to Kilo Code, whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, improving documentation, or sharing custom modes.

## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to Kilo Code:

1. **Code Contributions**: Implement new features or fix bugs
2. **Documentation**: Improve existing docs or create new guides
3. **Marketplace Contributions**: Create and share custom modes, skills, and MCP servers via the [Kilo Marketplace](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilo-marketplace)
4. **Bug Reports**: Report issues you encounter
5. **Feature Requests**: Suggest new features or improvements
6. **Community Support**: Help other users in the community

## Setting Up the Development Environment

Setting Up the Development Environment is described in details on the [Development Environment](/docs/contributing/development-environment) page.

## Understanding the Architecture

Before diving into the code, we recommend reviewing the [Architecture Overview](/docs/contributing/architecture) to understand how the different components of Kilo Code fit together.

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix
- Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/new-tool-support` or `fix/browser-action-bug`)
- **For documentation only changes**: Use the `docs/` prefix (e.g., `docs/improve-mcp-guide`)

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name

# For documentation changes:
git checkout -b docs/your-change-description
```

### Coding Standards

- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Use TypeScript for new code
- Include appropriate tests for new features
- Update documentation for any user-facing changes

### Commit Guidelines

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Reference issue numbers when applicable
- Keep commits focused on a single change

### Changesets

User-facing changes (features, fixes, breaking changes) require a changeset file so the update shows up in the next release notes. Run the interactive tool, or create the file by hand:

```bash
bunx changeset add
```

Or create `.changeset/<slug>.md` manually:

```md
---
"kilo-code": minor
---

Short description of the change for the changelog.
```

Guidelines:

- Use `patch` for bug fixes, `minor` for new features, `major` for breaking changes.
- Descriptions are read by end users in release notes — keep them concise and feature-oriented. Describe **what changed from the user's perspective**, not implementation details.
- Write in imperative mood (e.g. "Support exporting conversations as markdown" rather than "Add a new export handler that serializes session messages to .md files").
- Changesets are consumed at release time by the `publish.yml` workflow, which generates changelog entries for the GitHub release notes.

Skip the changeset only for internal refactors, CI tweaks, test-only changes, or docs that do not affect users.

### Other Guardrails

- Regenerate `packages/sdk/js/` with `./script/generate.ts` after changing server endpoints.
- Run `bun run script/extract-source-links.ts` after adding or changing guarded URLs in `packages/kilo-vscode/`, `packages/kilo-vscode/webview-ui/`, or `packages/opencode/src/`.
- When editing shared `packages/opencode/` files, keep Kilo changes small and mark Kilo-only edits with `// kilocode_change` for a single line or `// kilocode_change start` / `// kilocode_change end` for a block. Do not add these markers inside `kilocode`-named paths.

### Testing Your Changes

Use the current Bun commands in the [Development Environment](/docs/contributing/development-environment) guide for repo-level, CLI, backend/API, VS Code extension, and docs checks.

Key reminders:

- Do **not** run `bun test` from the repo root. The root test script intentionally exits with failure so tests run from the package that owns them.
- Use the root [TESTING.md](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/blob/main/TESTING.md) guide for backend/API validation with `bun dev serve` and `curl`-based requests.
- Regenerate the SDK with `./script/generate.ts` from the repo root after changing server endpoints.
- Manually verify extension behavior with `bun run extension`.
- For manual documentation validation, preview the affected page and check changed links and rendered content.

Before marking a PR ready for review, include testing evidence in the PR template. See [Testing Evidence for Pull Requests](/docs/contributing/development-environment#testing-evidence-for-pull-requests) for the full standard, including docs/config-only verification and blocked command fallback requirements.

### Creating a Pull Request

1. Push your changes to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

2. Go to the [Kilo Code repository](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode)

3. Click "New Pull Request" and select "compare across forks"

4. Select your fork and branch

5. Fill out the PR template with:
   - A clear description of the changes
   - Any related issues
   - Testing evidence, including commands run and results
   - Manual/local verification performed
   - Any command blocker plus substitute verification
   - Screenshots (if applicable)

## Contributing to the Kilo Marketplace

The [Kilo Marketplace](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilo-marketplace) is a community-driven repository of agent tooling that extends Kilo Code's capabilities. You can contribute:

- **Skills**: Modular workflows and domain expertise that teach agents how to perform specific tasks
- **MCP Servers**: Standardized integrations that connect agents to external tools and services
- **Modes**: Custom agent personalities and behaviors with tailored tool access

To contribute:

1. Follow the documentation for [Custom Modes](/docs/customize/custom-modes), [Skills](/docs/customize/skills), or [MCP Servers](/docs/automate/mcp/overview) to create your resource

2. Test your contribution thoroughly

3. Submit a pull request to the [Kilo Marketplace repository](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilo-marketplace)

## Engineering Specs

For larger features, we write engineering specs to align on requirements before implementation. Check out the [Architecture](/docs/contributing/architecture) section to see planned features and learn how to contribute specs.

## Documentation Contributions

Documentation improvements are highly valued contributions:

1. Follow the documentation style guide:
   - Use clear, concise language
   - Include examples where appropriate
   - Use absolute paths starting from `/docs/` for internal links (except within the same directory)
   - Don't include `.md` extensions in links

2. Test your documentation changes and run the docs site locally from the repo root:

   ```bash
   bun run --filter @kilocode/kilo-docs test
   bun run --filter @kilocode/kilo-docs build
   bun run --filter @kilocode/kilo-docs dev
   ```

   For manual validation, preview the affected page and check changed links and rendered content.

3. Submit a PR with your documentation changes
